            <>Cybersecurity is important because it protects all categories of data from theft and damage. This includes sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII),
        </p1>
                 protected health information (PHI), personal information, intellectual property, data, and governmental and industry information systems.
                 Without a cybersecurity program, your organization cannot defend itself against data breach campaigns, which makes it an irresistible target for cybercriminals.

                Both inherent risk and residual risk are increasing, driven by global connectivity and usage of cloud services, like Amazon Web Services, to store sensitive
                 data and personal information. Widespread poor configuration of cloud services paired with increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals means the risk that your 
                 organization suffers from a successful cyber attack or data breach is on the rise.</p>
               <p2> Cyber threats can come from any level of your organization. Workplaces must include cybersecurity awareness training to educate staff about common cyber
                 threats like social engineering scams, phishing, ransomware attacks (think WannaCry), and other malware designed to steal intellectual property or personal data.

                The proliferation of data breaches means that cybersecurity is not just relevant to heavily regulated industries, like healthcare. Even small businesses are at risk 
                of suffering irrecoverable reputational damage following a data breach.
                
                To help you understand the importance of cyber security, we've compiled a post explaining the different elements of cybercrime you may not be aware of. If you're
                 not yet worried about cybersecurity risks, you should be.
